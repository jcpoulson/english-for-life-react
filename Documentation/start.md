# Hello There welcome to the documentation for the front-end of the English For life Project

You may have already read in the README that this project runs on the JavaScript React framework, now that may seem intimidating but don't worry although React is a lot at first, it really is quite simple and minimalistic yet very powerful. I do recommend that before starting to work on this project that you have a solid foundation in HTML (You actually will write very little to no HTML in this project, you will however write a lot of JSX, which is a feature of React that is very similar to HTML) CSS and JavaScript.

You don't need to be a React master to start working on this project but I do recommend that you be comfortable with these features of React

- React Components (Class and function Components)
- JSX
- Props
- State
- React Router
- You do not need to know about React hooks but I highly recommend it as the main component library this project uses, relies heavily on React hooks

Another thing which is not part of React that you will need to know is how to use communicate with an API, I recommend Axios, however you may use what you like

Another thing that goes along with communicating with an API is Asynchronous Programming, that can seem very daunting and confusing at first but it has gotten easier with the addition of things like promises and async/await. This is very **Critical** as you won't be able to retrieve using data from the server/API without it, and as well, Asynchronous Programming is very huge component of the backend of this application and is seen in almost every function written in the backend.
